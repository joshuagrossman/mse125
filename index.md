## Course Description

An increasing amount of data is now generated in a variety of disciplines, 
ranging from finance and economics, to the natural and social sciences.
Making use of this information requires both statistical tools and an
understanding of how the substantive scientific questions should drive
the analysis. In this hands-on course, we learn to explore and analyze
real-world datasets. We cover techniques for summarizing and describing data,
methods for statistical inference, and principles for effectively communicating 
results.

Prerequisites:
MS&E 120 or equivalent, and CS 106A or equivalent

## Course communication 

We use the [Ed platform](https://canvas.stanford.edu/) to manage course questions and discussion.

We highly encourage you to use our (anonymous) 
[comment box](https://forms.gle/WzuDbpi1H4siTgfz9)
to let us know which aspects of the class
are going well and which could be improved.

## Diversity statement

It is our intent that students from all backgrounds and perspectives be well served by this course, that students' learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength, and benefit. We aim to present materials and conduct activities in ways that are respectful of this diversity. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let us know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally or for other students or student groups.

## Computing environment

We primarily use [R](http://www.r-project.org/), and [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/) is the recommended interface.
We extensively use the suite of [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) packages.

<!-- ## Just the Class

TEST TEST Just the Class is a GitHub Pages template developed for the purpose of quickly deploying course websites. In addition to serving plain web pages and files, it provides a boilerplate for:

- a [course calendar](calendar.md),
- a [staff](staff.md) page,
- and a weekly [schedule](schedule.md).

Just the Class is a set of customizations on top of the popular [Just the Docs](https://github.com/pmarsceill/just-the-docs) theme, which provides a robust and thoroughly-tested foundation that makes it easy to extend for your own special use cases. These foundational features include:

- automatic [navigation structure](https://pmarsceill.github.io/just-the-docs/docs/navigation-structure/),
- instant, full-text [search](https://pmarsceill.github.io/just-the-docs/docs/search/) and page indexing,
- and a small but powerful set of [UI components](https://pmarsceill.github.io/just-the-docs/docs/ui-components) and authoring [utilities](https://pmarsceill.github.io/just-the-docs/docs/utilities).

## Getting Started

Getting started with Just the Class is simple.

1. Create a [new repository based on Just the Class](https://github.com/kevinlin1/just-the-class/generate).
1. Update `_config.yml` and `index.md` with your course information. Be sure to update the `baseurl` and `url` to the appropriate paths (eg. "/20au" and "https://courses.cs.washington.edu/", respectively.).
1. Configure a [publishing source for GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-github-pages). Your course website is now live!
1. Edit and create `.md` [Markdown files](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) to add your content.

Just the Class has been used by instructors at Stanford University ([CS 161](https://stanford-cs161.github.io/winter2021/)), UC Berkeley ([Data 100](https://ds100.org/fa21/)), UC Santa Barbara ([DS1](https://ucsb-ds.github.io/ds1-f20/)), Northeastern University ([CS4530/5500](https://neu-se.github.io/CS4530-CS5500-Spring-2021/)), and Carnegie Mellon University ([17-450/17-950](https://cmu-crafting-software.github.io/)). For a few open-source examples, see the following course websites and their source code.

- [CSE 390HA](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse390ha/20au/) ([source code](https://gitlab.cs.washington.edu/cse390ha/20au/website)) is an example of a single-page website that centers modules.
- [CSE 143](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse143/20au/) ([source code](https://gitlab.cs.washington.edu/cse143/20au/website)) hosts an entire online textbook with full-text search.
- [CSE 373](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse373/21su/) ([source code](https://gitlab.cs.washington.edu/cse373-root/21su/website)) is an example of a simple website combining Markdown pages with generated HTML files.

Continue reading to learn how to setup a development environment on your local computer. This allows you to make incremental changes without directly modifying the live website.

### Local development environment

Just the Class is built for [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), a static site generator. View the [quick start guide](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) for more information. Just the Docs requires no special Jekyll plugins and can run on GitHub Pages' standard Jekyll compiler.

1. Follow the GitHub documentation for [Setting up your GitHub Pages site locally with Jekyll](https://help.github.com/en/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll).
1. Start your local Jekyll server.
```bash
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
```
1. Point your web browser to [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)
1. Reload your web browser after making a change to preview its effect.
