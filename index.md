## Course Description

An increasing amount of data is now generated in a variety of disciplines, 
ranging from finance and economics, to the natural and social sciences.
Making use of this information requires both statistical tools and an
understanding of how the substantive scientific questions should drive
the analysis. In this hands-on course, we learn to explore and analyze
real-world datasets. We cover techniques for summarizing and describing data,
methods for statistical inference, and principles for effectively communicating 
results.

Prerequisites:
MS&E 120 or equivalent, and CS 106A or equivalent

questions about career trajectories, and [research opportunities](https://sites.google.com/stanford.edu/msande-inclusion/diversity-in-research) in MS&E and beyond.

Please note that there are no regular office hours during the first week of class, but feel free to schedule an appointment if you would like to meet.

### Grading policies

- 7 homework assignments (50%)
- 2 take-home quizzes (25%)
- Project proposal and final project (20%)
- Attendance and participation (5%)

Late homework will not be accepted, but your lowest homework grade will be dropped.

Unless otherwise stated, assignments are to be done individually.
You are welcome to work with others to master the principles and approaches used to
solve the homework problems, but the work you turn in should be your own.
Under no circumstance should you seek out or look at solutions to assignments given in previous years.

### Quiz details

You will have 24 hours to complete each quiz.
The quizzes are open book/computer.
They consists of 5 true/false and 15 multiple-choice questions.
The quizzes is designed to take approximately 1 hour.
Instructions to access the quiz will be posted on Canvas at 12:01 am.

**You must complete each quiz on your own. Giving or receiving any form of aid on the quizzes is a violation of the honor code.**  

The first quiz tests the conceptual ideas presented during weeks 1-3 (through parametric inference).
The second quiz tests the material presented in weeks 4-9.

### Project details

In teams of 2-5 people, please complete the [project proposal form](https://forms.gle/diGr9yZT1TRVHuDe9).

You are free to pursue any topic related to applied statistics.
In previous years, teams have considered
athletic performance, gender inequality, farming practices, restaurant quality,
music success, gentrification, and standardized testing, just to name a few.
Any data-driven investigation is fair game.
At the end of the quarter, each team will prepare either a 10-page written report
or a 10-minute video presentation.

To help assess the feasibility and suitability of your project,
please discuss your idea with the teaching staff before submitting your proposal.
Your group should
sign up for a [15-minute meeting slot](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18Epg8PxHLWXZTWMLRf_lAweGtxcwaqg9NU0A8gvP9L8/edit?usp=sharing).
It is ideal if all members of your group can attend the meeting but, at a minimum, two members should be present. (This meeting is a required part of the assignment.)

Upon completing the project, we'll ask each student to evaluate the contributions of their team members, and we'll consider these peer-reviews when determining final grades.

## Study groups

We encourage you to work together in groups to solidify your understanding of the course material. 
If you would like assistance forming a study group, please complete [this form](https://forms.gle/j2mvdr3bfBkMcqF3A) by XX at XXpm PT. 
Our goal is to form the study groups the following day, 
so students can begin discussing the first homework assignment.

## Course communication 

We use the [Ed platform](https://canvas.stanford.edu/) to manage course questions and discussion.

We highly encourage you to use our (anonymous) 
[comment box](https://forms.gle/WzuDbpi1H4siTgfz9)
to let us know which aspects of the class
are going well and which could be improved.

## Computing environment

We primarily use [R](http://www.r-project.org/), and [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/) is the recommended interface.
We extensively use the suite of [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) packages.
