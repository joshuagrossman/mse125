In preparation for the first discussion section,
install <a href="http://www.rstudio.com/">RStudio</a>
(which in turn requires installing <a href="http://cran.rstudio.com/">R</a>).
[Section 1.4](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/introduction.html#prerequisites) of R for Data Science has some tips for installation.
Feel free to post on [Ed](https://canvas.stanford.edu) with any installation problems.

## Project proposal

Due date: Tuesday, April 26, 9pm PT

In teams of 2-5 people, please complete the [project proposal form](https://forms.gle/U43xgsifpU3Kng2H7).

You are free to pursue any topic related to applied statistics.
In previous years, teams have considered
athletic performance, gender inequality, farming practices, restaurant quality,
music success, gentrification, and standardized testing, just to name a few.
Any data-driven investigation is fair game.
At the end of the quarter, each team will prepare either a 10-page written report
or a 10-minute video presentation.

To help assess the feasibility and suitability of your project,
please discuss your idea with the teaching staff before submitting your proposal.
Your group should
sign up for a [15-minute meeting slot]().
It is ideal if all members of your group can attend the meeting but, at a minimum, two members should be present. (This meeting is a required part of the assignment.)

Upon completing the project, we'll ask each student to evaluate the contributions of their team members, and we'll consider these peer-reviews when determining final grades.
